Managerial Effectiveness Performance Review

1. Leadership and Vision In my role, I have consistently demonstrated strong leadership by guiding cross-functional teams across the organization. Through my efforts in onboarding new team members and managing communication with various stakeholders such as users, vendors, and cross-team members, I have ensured alignment with both short-term goals and broader organizational objectives. By leading and participating in cultural and networking activities, I have not only helped foster a positive work environment but also contributed to team cohesion and motivation.

Key Example: My role in onboarding the Dividend Projection in Fabric, where I successfully onboarded the Bloomberg flow and initiated UAT testing with Data Services, reflects my ability to lead projects that align with business objectives while keeping my team motivated and engaged.

2. Communication A core strength of mine has been maintaining clear and open lines of communication. I have effectively communicated complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, making sure that everyone involved understood the progress and challenges of various projects. My focus on hosting knowledge-sharing sessions across multiple teams, including RPE, DataLink, and Fabric, has been instrumental in breaking down silos and fostering collaboration.

Key Example: I played a pivotal role in defining the taxonomy across SRD applications, collaborating with the Operations team to document each control in major applications such as P2 and EA. This initiative not only improved clarity but also enhanced cross-team understanding of critical processes.

3. Decision-Making I have consistently demonstrated the ability to make informed, strategic decisions under pressure, particularly in urgent production situations. By leveraging data and team input, I have ensured that decisions are aligned with organizational objectives and stakeholder needs. My approach to problem-solving balances both the short-term resolution of issues and long-term strategy.

Key Example: In stabilizing the ESM Stack plant for observability, I made data-driven decisions that contributed to a smooth transition to a central plant for onboarding observability apps. This required balancing technical constraints with user requirements while meeting tight deadlines.


---

4. Delegation and Empowerment In my management role, I have focused on empowering team members by delegating responsibilities that align with their strengths and development goals. This has resulted in increased accountability and professional growth within the team. I have also taken ownership of tasks that required a high level of expertise, ensuring that projects moved forward efficiently.

Key Example: During the onboarding process for Dividend Projection and the implementation of DQ checks across vendors, I delegated specific tasks while ensuring oversight. This not only enabled the team to work autonomously but also fostered a sense of ownership and accountability.


---

5. Team Development and Motivation I have actively contributed to the professional development of my team through knowledge-sharing initiatives and by mentoring newer team members. My involvement in cultural and networking events has helped cultivate a positive work environment, contributing to team engagement and satisfaction. I also ensure that team members are recognized for their contributions, which has improved team morale.

Key Example: My leadership in hosting and participating in networking and cultural activities has been critical to maintaining a cohesive and motivated team, even in times of high pressure.

6. Time Management and Prioritization Time management has been a critical aspect of my role, particularly in managing multiple projects with overlapping deadlines. I have successfully balanced the day-to-day operations of the observability team with long-term strategic planning. My ability to prioritize has ensured that key projects, such as the onboarding of observability apps and stabilization of the ESM Stack, were delivered on time without compromising quality.

Key Example: The observability team’s progress—marked by new capabilities like SQL to Metric and database replication—reflects my effective time management and ability to prioritize key tasks amidst other challenges like poor SLA performance from external teams.


---

Conclusion My performance in managerial effectiveness has been demonstrated through my leadership in cross-functional initiatives, clear communication, and strategic decision-making. I have fostered a culture of empowerment and collaboration, ensuring that both the team and organizational goals are met. Through my ability to delegate, motivate, and prioritize, I have contributed to the successful delivery of key projects and overall team development.
