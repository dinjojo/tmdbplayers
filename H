To determine the best approach for implementing anomaly detection, here's an optimal order to proceed based on data complexity, ease of implementation, and the type of anomalies you want to detect:
1. Start with Facebook Prophet

    Why: It's easy to implement, handles irregular time-series data well, and automatically handles seasonality and missing values. If your primary data concerns time-series anomalies (e.g., listing prices, tick sizes), Prophet should be your first choice.
    Steps:
        Apply Prophet to historical time-series data (e.g., listing prices or expiry dates).
        Generate forecasts and use the model to identify anomalies by comparing actual data to the predicted values.

2. Try Z-Score/Statistical Thresholding for Simple Fields

    Why: It's a simple and fast method for low-dimensional static data that follows a Gaussian distribution (e.g., sector classification or tick size).
    Steps:
        Calculate the Z-score (deviation from the mean) for each data point.
        Flag data points that exceed a certain threshold (e.g., ±3 standard deviations) as anomalies.

3. Use SARIMA for Well-Defined, Stationary Time-Series Data

    Why: If Prophet’s forecasts are insufficient (e.g., due to lack of seasonality), SARIMA can be a more controlled choice for stationary, seasonal data.
    Steps:
        Use SARIMA for time-series data that require explicit modeling of trends and seasonality (e.g., for listing prices that follow a regular seasonal pattern).
        Tune the ARIMA parameters and validate the model before applying anomaly detection.

4. Implement Isolation Forest for Cross-Field Anomalies

    Why: Once you're confident with time-series anomaly detection, Isolation Forest is the next step for detecting multi-dimensional anomalies across different fields (e.g., discrepancies between listing price and sector). It handles high-dimensional data and doesn't require assumptions about data distribution.
    Steps:
        Apply Isolation Forest on datasets with multiple features, like vendor feeds or attribute combinations.
        Tune parameters like the number of trees and the maximum sample size for optimal results.

5. Consider Autoencoders for High-Complexity, Multi-Dimensional Data

    Why: If your data complexity increases and you're dealing with large datasets or non-linear patterns, Autoencoders can help capture intricate relationships between fields. However, they are computationally intensive and require deep learning knowledge.
    Steps:
        Implement Autoencoders after you've addressed basic anomalies using simpler models.
        Fine-tune the architecture (layers, neurons) for anomaly detection based on the reconstruction error.

Summary of Order:

    Start with Facebook Prophet for time-series anomalies (easy implementation and robust handling of irregular data).
    Use Z-Score/Statistical Thresholding for simple, low-dimensional data.
    Try SARIMA for more controlled, seasonal time-series data.
    Move to Isolation Forest for multi-dimensional anomaly detection.
    Consider Autoencoders if your data is highly complex and high-dimensional.

This approach allows you to handle simpler cases first, ensuring faster implementation and refining your detection models as complexity increases. Would you like help with setting up any specific model?
