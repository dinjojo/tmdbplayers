Latika has excelled this year, especially in the EA migration project where she played a pivotal role in transitioning market data from legacy systems to Fabric. She led cross-team discussions with EA and Fabric, tackled complex xref rules for Markit data in Talend, and optimized 12 out of 15 major transformers, simplifying the legacy hardcoded logic into manageable rules with the help of Rachit. Her work enhanced code readability, and she documented and shared these improvements with the EA team, showcasing her collaborative and communicative approach. Additionally, Latika implemented the ACE engine for Markit vs. EA data comparison, significantly improving the transformation process.

In legacy support, Latika took ownership of key tasks like T+1 migration, handling production incidents, and resolving user queries, contributing to the operational stability of the team. She also led initiatives to boost efficiency, such as creating a Dividend Projection FAQ for quick query resolution and planning the BDVD stream. Her attention to compliance and risk management was evident, especially in her thorough testing approach for production deployments. During T+1 migration, she proactively addressed concerns to ensure adherence to deployment protocols, reflecting her commitment to quality.

Peers recognize Latika as a self-starter with a strong analytical mindset, quick adaptability, and willingness to collaborate. Her contributions to Dividend Projection modernization and the EA SRDF Talend project have earned her respect for her expertise and openness to learning. Latikaâ€™s growth in technical skills and her positive, team-oriented approach make her a valuable asset to the team, with great potential to make an even larger impact in future projects.
