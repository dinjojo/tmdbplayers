Latika has shown exceptional technical ability and dedication to collaboration, particularly in her work on Fabric and EA transformation projects. She is committed to further strengthening her skills, particularly in decision-making and thorough analysis, to improve the effectiveness of team discussions. She has expressed a clear goal to deepen her understanding of index points data and its business context, which will enable her to contribute more effectively to the migration of index points feeds.

Her colleagues recognize her impressive work with the xref and Backbridge transformations, along with her ability to network and collaborate across teams. As she continues to grow, a focus on developing her knowledge of design patterns and frameworks used within DivProj, along with a deeper understanding of the business domain, will allow her to design even better solutions. Additionally, exploring areas outside of core development, such as DevOps, could further enhance her effectiveness and broaden her skill set.

Latikaâ€™s team also sees value in a greater understanding of business use cases for corporate actions, including potential impacts on different business areas. By combining her extensive system knowledge with deeper business insights, Latika would be an invaluable asset not only to DivProj but to SRD as a whole.
