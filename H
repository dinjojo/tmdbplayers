### **Architecture Decision Review Document**  
#### **Subject**: Anomaly Detection Models for Reference Data  

---

### **1. Context**  
The reference data system ingests feeds from vendors (Reuters, Bloomberg) for equities and derivatives. The data includes attributes like listing price, tick size, expiry date, and sector classifications. The goal is to identify anomalies in:  
1. **Time-Series Data**: (e.g., listing price, tick size trends).  
2. **Multi-Dimensional Data**: (e.g., cross-field inconsistencies).  

---

### **2. Options Considered**

#### **Option 1: SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**  
- **Description**: A statistical model for univariate time-series analysis, capturing trends and seasonality.  
- **Pros**:  
  - Clear and interpretable results.  
  - Explicitly models seasonality and trends.  
  - Well-suited for clean, stationary time-series.  
- **Cons**:  
  - Limited to univariate data.  
  - Requires stationarity (may need data transformations).  
  - Complex parameter tuning (seasonal order, ARIMA terms).  
- **Suitable Data**:  
  - **Univariate Time-Series**: Daily listing prices, tick sizes, expiry dates with seasonal patterns.  

---

#### **Option 2: Facebook Prophet**  
- **Description**: A modern statistical tool for univariate time-series forecasting, designed for irregular and seasonal data.  
- **Pros**:  
  - Minimal pre-processing, handles missing data and outliers.  
  - Easy to implement with a user-friendly API.  
  - Decomposes forecasts into interpretable components (trend, seasonality, holidays).  
- **Cons**:  
  - Univariate focus; doesn’t handle multi-dimensional data.  
  - Limited control over advanced parameter tuning.  
- **Suitable Data**:  
  - **Univariate Time-Series**: Listing prices, tick sizes with irregularities or external seasonality.  

---

#### **Option 3: Z-Score/Statistical Thresholding**  
- **Description**: A simple statistical method that flags anomalies based on deviations from the mean.  
- **Pros**:  
  - Easy to implement and explain.  
  - Effective for normally distributed, low-dimensional data.  
- **Cons**:  
  - Assumes Gaussian distribution, which might not fit real-world data.  
  - Cannot capture seasonality, trends, or complex relationships.  
- **Suitable Data**:  
  - **Low-Dimensional Static Data**: Single fields like sector classification or tick size without time dependency.  

---

#### **Option 4: Isolation Forest**  
- **Description**: An unsupervised machine learning model that isolates anomalies in multi-dimensional data.  
- **Pros**:  
  - Handles high-dimensional, non-linear relationships.  
  - Robust to outliers in multi-dimensional datasets.  
  - Doesn’t require data stationarity or distribution assumptions.  
- **Cons**:  
  - Requires feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.  
  - Less interpretable compared to statistical models.  
- **Suitable Data**:  
  - **Multi-Dimensional Static Data**: Cross-field relationships (e.g., listing price, tick size, and sector consistency).  

---

#### **Option 5: Autoencoders**  
- **Description**: Neural networks trained to reconstruct input data, with reconstruction error used to identify anomalies.  
- **Pros**:  
  - Captures complex, high-dimensional data relationships.  
  - Effective for non-linear and non-stationary patterns.  
- **Cons**:  
  - Computationally intensive and harder to interpret.  
  - Requires deep learning expertise.  
- **Suitable Data**:  
  - **Complex Multi-Dimensional Data**: High-volume reference feeds with intricate relationships.

### **3. Decision Criteria**  

| Criterion                  | SARIMA         | Prophet        | Z-Score        | Isolation Forest  | Autoencoders     |  
|----------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|  
| **Ease of Implementation** | Moderate       | Easy           | Easy           | Moderate          | Difficult        |  
| **Data Type**              | Univariate     | Univariate     | Low-Dimensional| Multi-Dimensional | Multi-Dimensional|  
| **Scalability**            | Low            | Moderate       | Low            | High              | High             |  
| **Explainability**         | High           | High           | High           | Moderate          | Low              |  
| **Complexity Handling**    | Low            | Moderate       | Low            | High              | Very High        |

### **4. Recommendation**  
#### For **Time-Series Data**:  
- **Use Facebook Prophet** for ease of implementation and handling irregular time-series trends.  
- **Use SARIMA** if data is clean and seasonal patterns are well-defined.

#### For **Multi-Dimensional Data**:  
- **Use Isolation Forest** for detecting cross-field anomalies in heterogeneous data.  
- Consider **Autoencoders** if the data is very complex and relationships between attributes are highly non-linear.

#### For **Low-Dimensional Static Data**:  
- **Use Z-Score/Statistical Thresholding** for simple fields like sector classification.
